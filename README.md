## Notification System For School Club
A club at my school was having trouble getting notifications out to specific members of when events were planned or had been cancelled. I created this app to help solve this problem. The club leaders are able to add session dates to a Google spreadsheet, which the application reads from. The app then displays all the dates on a calendar, highlighting events that are planned or cancelled.
